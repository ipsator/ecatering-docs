### List of outlets at a station

This API can be used to create/update outlet information at a particular station.  
In case of any changes to outlet information at a station, the updated list of all outlets with the latest data must be pushed.  
If several outlets' data has to be updated, please make sure to batch all the changes in a single request instead of calling the API for each change. **Avoid making more than 5 requests in a minute against the same station & keep a delay of few seconds between each request.**  
This API should be called only when data needs to be updated. Please refrain from setting up a periodic sync mechanism that calls the APIs regularly irrespective of data changes.
Usage of the API in patterns deviating from above guidelines may lead to unexpected results. When this is unavoidable under rare scenarios, please reach out the tech team over email beforehand.

#### Promotional Discounts

To make promotional discounts available to customers for a particular outlet, a new `promotions` field has to be sent within the outlet object of outlet list API request.  
  
The `promotions` field is a list of objects.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
Each outlet can have up to 5 promotions. If more than 5 promotions are sent in request, the first 5 valid promotions will be considered & rest would get ignored.
</Callout>
  
Each object in the list defines a specific promotion and includes attributes that detail the promotion‚Äôs conditions and benefits. A coupon code is generated by the system which is displayed to the customer in the order flow.  
  
**Sample promotion object**  
```
{
    "requirement": {
        "type": "AMOUNT",
        "minimumOrderAmount": 100
    },
    "discount": {
        "type": "PERCENTAGE",
        "value": 10,
        "maxDiscount": 100
    }
}
```

Documented below are the key attributes of these promotion objects along with JSON examples to illustrate their meaning:  

- `requirement` (Object):
    - `type` (String): Describes the type of requirement for the promotion. It can be one of the following:
        - `AMOUNT`: The promotion is based on a minimum order amount.
        - `PAYMENT_TYPE`: The promotion depends on the selected payment type.
    - `minimumOrderAmount` (Number): Specifies the minimum order amount required to qualify for the promotion. The customer‚Äôs order subtotal (sum of basePrice of all items in cart) must meet or exceed this amount to be eligible for the discount.
    - `paymentType` (String): Applicable only if the requirement type is ‚ÄúPAYMENT_TYPE‚Äù. It specifies the payment type required for the promotion, such as ‚ÄúPRE_PAID‚Äù.
- `discount` (Object):
    - `type` (String): Indicates the type of discount offered, which can be one of the following:
        - `PERCENTAGE`: The discount is a percentage of the order amount.
        - `FLAT`: The discount is a fixed, flat amount.
    - `value` (Number): Specifies the value of the discount, which can be either a percentage or a flat amount.
    - `maxDiscount` (Number): Indicates the maximum discount amount that can be obtained through the promotion. A value of -1 indicates no maximum limit.

    }
]
```
This `promotions` field is expected in the outlet object documented in the previous section.

##### Regulations/Allowed Values

<Callout emoji="üí°">
Outlet data update API requests with promotions not meeting these regulations may fail with an error.
</Callout>

To strike a good balance between customer experience & fair business, the following conditions are enforced on promotional coupons:

###### For percentage discount coupons
- The discount percentage cannot exceed 15%.
- The maximum discount limit (if any) cannot be lower than the absolute value of the discount a customer can get for the corresponding minimum order amount.  
e.g. For a percentage discount coupon offering 10% off on a minimum order amount of ‚Çπ200, the maximum discount limit cannot be lower than ‚Çπ20.  
This would eliminate misleading offers such as '50% off up to ‚Çπ20 on orders above ‚Çπ200'.

###### For flat discount coupons
- The minimum order amount cannot be zero & discount value cannot exceed 15% of the minimum order amount.  
Example 1: For a flat discount coupon with a minimum order amount of ‚Çπ200, the maximum allowed discount value will be ‚Çπ30.  
Example 2: For a flat discount coupon offering ‚Çπ15 off, the lowest allowed minimum order amount will be ‚Çπ100.

#### Variable Delivery Charges

This feature enables configuration of multiple slabs for delivery charges based on total base order value (subtotal).

To enable variable delivery fees for a particular outlet, 
a new `deliveryCharges` field has to be sent within the outlet object of outlet list API request.

The `deliveryCharges` field is a list of objects.

Each outlet can have up to 3 delivery fee slabs. If more than 3 slabs are sent in request, the request would fail.

##### JSON Structure
The JSON list must be included in the outlet update API request under a new key `deliveryCharges` 
to enable the variable delivery fees feature.
The variable delivery fees are defined in a JSON list, where each object in the list represents a delivery fee slab.
The list should preferably be ordered from the lowest to the highest order base price.

Each object in the list has two fields:
- `amountMoreThan`: The minimum order base price for which the associated delivery fee should be applied.
- `deliveryFee`: The delivery fee to be applied for orders with a base price greater than or equal to the specified `amountMoreThan`.

##### JSON Examples
```
[
    {
        "amountMoreThan": 0,
        "deliveryFee": 30
    },
    {
        "amountMoreThan": 100,
        "deliveryFee": 20
    },
    {
        "amountMoreThan": 300,
        "deliveryFee": 0
    }
]
```

In this example, the variable delivery fees are defined as follows:
- For orders with a base price greater than ‚Çπ0 but less than ‚Çπ100, a delivery fee of ‚Çπ30 will be applied.
- For orders with a base price greater than or equal to ‚Çπ100, a reduced delivery fee of ‚Çπ20 will be applied.
- For orders with a base price greater than or equal to ‚Çπ300, no delivery fee will be applied.

##### Implementation
- The JSON list must be included in the outlet update API request under a new key `deliveryCharges` to enable the variable delivery fees feature.
- The `amountMoreThan` values must be unique for each fee slab.
- If an order's base price falls within a specific slab, the corresponding delivery fee for that slab will be applied.
- If no delivery fee is to be applied, the `deliveryCharges` field should be sent as `null`.
- If you want to apply a flat delivery fee i.e. a single fee slab, the `deliveryCharges` list should have a single item with `amountMoreThan` value as 0 & `deliveryFee` value as the required fee amount.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
The older static `deliveryCost` field will soon be deprecated in favour of this new `deliveryCharges` field.  
If you are a new partner integrating the APIs newly, please follow this section of the doc to implement delivery charges.

### list menu for a selected outlet:

This API can be used to create/update menu information for a particular outlet.  
In case of any changes to the menu information, the updated list of all items with the latest data must be pushed.  
If several items' data has to be updated, please make sure to batch all the changes in a single request instead of calling the API for each change. **Avoid making more than 5 requests in a minute against the same outlet & keep a delay of few seconds between each request.**
This API should be called only when data needs to be updated. Please refrain from setting up a periodic sync mechanism that calls the APIs regularly irrespective of data changes.
Usage of the API in patterns deviating from above guidelines may lead to unexpected results. When this is unavoidable under rare scenarios, please reach out the tech team over email beforehand.
  
**POST &lt;irctc_base_url>/api/v1/vendor/aggregator/station/&lt;STATION_CODE>/outlet/&lt;OUTLET_ID>**

<Callout emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
   The ```tax``` field within items of ```menuItems``` list has been **DEPRECATED** in favour of new

  Send 0.05 for 5%, 0.12 for 12% & so on.  
  Please migrate to the new key soon to avoid any discrepancies.  
    
  Please ensure that ```basePrice```, ```taxPercentage``` & ```sellingPrice``` fields for
  each item is accurate else the item will not get listed to users. For now, ```taxPercentage```
  must be "0.05" as only 5% GST rate is supported on eCatering as of now.

#### Menu item customisation

`customisations` field in the above request can be used to support customisation of menu items. An example use case would be allowing users to choose from different Pizza bases & sizes.  
There are 2 supported `type` values: `ONE_LEVEL` and `TWO_LEVEL`.  
The hierarchy is customisation -> variant -> option for `TWO_LEVEL` and customisation -> variant for `ONE_LEVEL`.
When `customisations` is non-null, `customisationDefaultBasePrice` within the menu item object is used to display the item's base price to user on the menu page. In most cases this is expected to be the total base price of the default customisation.  
This structure should allow for numerous possible customisation setups including combo choices, addons, etc.
Some customisation configurations may not be supported on forward order assets yet & would be planned for future. Please check with us regarding the current status.

Please refer the below sample for details. Only values with 'optional' in comment are optional & can be null.
